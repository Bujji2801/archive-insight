PlagioSense: Semantic & Rule-Based Discovery
PlagioSense is an elite, high-fidelity academic project explorer designed to solve the challenge of idea-level duplication in university settings. Built with a "Mastery through Curiosity" mindset, it leverages semantic analysis and a premium "Editorial Light" aesthetic to provide transparent, explainable project audits.

✨ Key Features
Semantic Layered Scanning: A multi-layered engine that analyzes abstracts, keywords, and intent using NLP techniques like Cosine Similarity.

Bento Grid Explorer: A high-performance, responsive project directory with "Quick View" hover states and smooth Framer Motion transitions.

Interactive Creative Engine: A signature ParticleCanvas Hero section and floating background orbs that respond to user interaction.

Elite UI Architecture: A professional-grade Light Mode design inspired by Heizen.work, utilizing Geist/Inter typography and a minimalist 1px border strategy.

Project Roadmap: AI-driven suggestions for base papers and technical stack upgrades to foster original academic contributions.

🛠️ Technical Stack
Framework: React 18 with Vite 5 for high-speed delivery.

Language: TypeScript 5.8 for strict, production-ready typing.

Styling: Tailwind CSS 3 & shadcn/ui customized for an "Editorial" aesthetic.

Animations: Framer Motion for zero-regression, smooth layout transitions.

Intelligence: Heuristic token-matching engine (Architecture ready for TanStack Query & RAG integration).
